# getxbook

getxbook is a collection of tools to download books from websites.

* getgbook - downloads from google books' "book preview"
* getabook - downloads from amazon's "look inside the book"
* getbnbook - downloads from barnes and noble's "book viewer"

## why

Online book websites are designed not around reading, but around
surveillance. It is not merely the selection of book that is
recorded, but exactly what is read, when, and for how long.
Forever. And this is linked to all other information the website
holds about you (which in the case of Google and Amazon is likely
to be a great deal).

Reading books is one of the holiest acts in our society. Limiting
and monitoring it is a grave act; it is censorship, whether its
goal is profit or more direct political control. And it is
dangerous.

The getxbook program downloads books anonymously. Using it will
still result in your IP address being logged (use
[torify](https://www.torproject.org) to stop this), but reading
habits won't be automatically linked to other personal information
websites hold, as no existing cookies are used. Once the book is
downloaded, it can be read without any further prying.

Being free to do what you like with a book, you can also load it
onto any device you have access to, share it, study it, read it
offline, and do anything else you can do with normal computer files.
You can easily use OCR software to get text versions of downloaded
books, making them accessible to people who can't easily read from
the page scans.

"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every
form of tyranny over the mind of man."
 - *Thomas Jefferson*

## technical

Each tool is written in around 200 lines of portable C code, with no
dependencies beyond libc and network sockets. It should work well on
Linux, BSDs, OSX and Windows. There is an optional graphical
interface, built with Tcl/Tk. There are some simple scripts to create
searchable PDF, DjVu, or plain text files from the downloaded pages,
which use tesseract OCR software.
