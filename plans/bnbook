barnes & noble have a 'book viewer'/'see
inside'. it is flash, which sucks. 'powered by zinio.com'

it seems you're only 'allowed' to open the viewer 2 or 3
times per book per ip. if not, you get plain html, but
seemingly only back & front covers:

http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/imageviewer.asp?ean=9780312551834&imId=65309649

the flash urls are of the form:
http://search2.barnesandnoble.com/BookViewer/?ean=9780061655944

which leads to xml:
http://search2.barnesandnoble.com/BookViewer/bookxml.asp?ean=9780061655944
which leads to:
http://search2.barnesandnoble.com/DigBooks/viewer/bookviewmanager.aspx?op=getbookinfo&ean=9780061655944
this is xml, which has paths of for different qualities (for
low quality, use tn rather than fp):
http://search2.barnesandnoble.com/digbooks/proxy/54/9780312361983/%d/fp
the %d can be replaced with the page number
requesting a page which isn't available
(freevendstatus="false") returns the standard book swf
