.SH NAME
getxbookgui \- a graphical interface to download books
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B getxbookgui
.SH DESCRIPTION
getxbookgui is a frontend to a set of tools which download books
from several websites.
.PP
Books will be downloaded to the directory that getxbookgui was
run from, into a directory named as the book id or ISBN number.
If not run from the command line, this will typically be in your
home directory.
.SH NOTES
The getxbook tools will not try to download pages that have
already been downloaded, so closing it and then starting it
again later will continue downloading from where it left off.
.PP
Book pages vary in availability depending on the book, the
website, and potentially the location of your IP.
.PP
getxbookgui checks the clipboard, and if a recognised book URL
is copied into it, it automatically recognises it and sets
the book id and website ready to start downloading it. This
behaviour is disabled if the options are manually changed, to
ensure manually set options aren't accidentally overwritten.
.PP
Additional functionality is available by running the individual
getxbook tools from the command line.
