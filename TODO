before 1.0: fix http bug, package for osx

# other todos

bug in get() & post(): if the \r\n\r\n after http headers is cut off between recv buffers

in getgbook, check that downloaded page doesn't match 'page not available' image; if so delete (as may be redownloadable later, perhaps even then with different cookies)

package for osx - https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer

use something smarter than update in gui to stop freezing

add https support to get (getabook can use it everywhere, others cannot)

write some little tests

submit 'pad' file to websites http://padsites.asp-software.org/
