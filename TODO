try supporting 3xx in get, if it can be done in a few lines
 by getting Location line, freeing buf, and returning a new
 iteration.

add https support to get

write some little tests

## getgbook

Note: looks like google allows around 3 page requests per cookie session, and exactly 31 per ip per [some time period > 18 hours]. If I knew the time period, could make a script that gets maybe 20 pages, waits for some time period, then continues.

got a stack trace when a connection seemingly timed out (after around 30 successful calls to -p). enable core dumping and re-run (note have done a small amount of hardening since, but bug is probably still there).

running it from scripts (getgfailed.sh and getgmissing.sh), refuses to Ctrl-C exit, and creates 2 processes, which may be killed independently. not related to torify
	multiple processes seems to be no bother
	ctrl-c seems to be the loop continuing rather than breaking on ctrl-c; e.g. pressing it enough times to end loop works.
	due to ctrl-c on a program which is using a pipe continues the loop rather than breaking it. using || break works, but breaks real functionality in the scripts 
	see seq 5|while read i; do echo run $i; echo a|sleep 5||break; done vs seq 5|while read i; do echo run $i; echo a|sleep 5; do
	trapping signals doesn't help; the trap is only reached on last iteration; e.g. when it will exit the script anyway
