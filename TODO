try supporting 3xx in get, if it can be done in a few lines
 by getting Location line, freeing buf, and returning a new
 iteration.

add https support to get

write some little tests

have websummary.sh print the date of release, e.g.

mkdir of bookid and save pages in there

### notes

Google will give you up to 5 cookies which get useful pages in immediate succession. It will stop serving new pages to the ip, even with a fresh cookie. So the cookie is certainly not everything.

If one does something too naughty, all requests from the ip to books.google.com are blocked with a 403 'automated requests' error for 24 hours. What causes this ip block is less clear. It certainly isn't after just trying lots of pages with 5 cookies. It seems to be after requesting 100 new cookies in a certain time period - 100 in 5 minutes seemed to do it, as did 100 in ~15 minutes.

The method of getting all pages from book webpage does miss some; they aren't all listed. These pages can often be requested, though, though at present getgbook can't, as if a page isn't in its initial structure it won't save the url, even if it's presented.
