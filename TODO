before 1.0: create bn tool, fix http bugs, package for osx & windows

# getbnbook

# other todos

use the correct file extension depending on the image type (for google and amazon
the first page is a jpg, all the others are png)

bug in get() & post(): if the \r\n\r\n after http headers is cut off between recv buffers

what happens if we receive not a http header? does recv loop forever, in a memory killing manner?

package for osx
package for windows
	have tcl as a starpack. have it always reference the executables in its directory, and we're golden.

try supporting 3xx in get, if it can be done in a few lines
 by getting Location line, freeing buf, and returning a new
 iteration.

use something smarter than update in gui to stop freezing

add https support to get

write some little tests

would likely be rather tricky, but building for android
would be nice. how it would work would be modifying the
getgbook src slightly, redefining function calls to be
findable by the java, and then writing java stuffs to call
it. gui could either be done from the java directly, or from
xml; both are gross options. see:

create 'pad' file (like a stupid version of doap), to get windows shareware folks in
