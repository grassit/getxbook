try supporting 3xx in get, if it can be done in a few lines
 by getting Location line, freeing buf, and returning a new
 iteration.

add https support to get

write some little tests

## getgbook

have file extension be determined by file type, rather than assuming png

think about whether default functionality should be dl all, rather than -a

to be fast and efficient it's best to crank through all the json 1st, filling in an array of page structs as we go
	this requires slightly fuller json support
	could consider making a json reading module, ala confoo, to make ad-hoc memory structures from json

Note: looks like google allows around 3 page requests per cookie session, and about 40 per ip per [some time period]. If I knew the time period, could make a script that gets all it can, gets a list of failures, waits, then tries failures, etc. Note these would also have to stop at some point; some pages just aren't available
