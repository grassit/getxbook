before 1.0: fix http bugs, package for osx & windows

# other todos

use the correct file extension depending on the image type (for google and amazon the first page is a jpg, all the others are png)

bug in get() & post(): if the \r\n\r\n after http headers is cut off between recv buffers

what happens if we receive not a http header? does recv loop forever, in a memory killing manner?

package for osx - https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer

use something smarter than update in gui to stop freezing

add https support to get (getabook can use it everywhere, others cannot)

write some little tests

create 'pad' file (like a stupid version of doap), to get windows shareware folks in
	http://pad.asp-software.org/
	http://padsites.asp-software.org/
	http://pad.asp-software.org/repository/user/submit.php?Home=user
	note that it must include all fields, with irrelevant ones being self-closed
	(mostly there, needs cleaning and automating and self-closed crap)

# consider text ripping

amazon one method is get "kindle preview": curl -d 'method=getKindleSample&asin=B002MQYOFW'
