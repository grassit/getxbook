# Overview

While legal "agreements" (which consider themselves signed
by using a service they mention) tend to be hostile, using
the standard for determining what an automated tool is
allowed to do on a server, robots.txt, all of the getxbook
tools are permitted.

## Terms of Service

Google's terms of service are ambiguous. On the one hand they
forbid using anything but a browser to access their sites.
This is absurd and ruinous. On the other hand, however, they
state that one should abide by the rules of robots.txt, which
are only relevant for non-browser access. A reasonable
interpretation would be that non-browsers are allowed to
access Google's services as long as they abide by robots.txt
See section 5.3 of http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS.

## robots.txt

Their robots.txt allows certain book URLs, but disallows
others.

We use three types of URL:
http://books.google.com/books?id=<bookid>&printsec=frontcover
http://books.google.com/books?id=<bookid>&pg=<pgcode>&jscmd=click3
http://books.google.com/books?id=<bookid>&pg=<pgcode>&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&<sig>

robots.txt disallows /books?*jscmd=* and /books?*pg=*. However,
Google consider Allow statements to overrule disallow statements
if they are longer. And they happen to allow /books?*q=subject:*.
So, we append that to the urls (it has no effect on them), and
we are obeying robots.txt

## Conditions of Use

With Amazon, massive overreach rules the day. In the "license and
site access" section of Amazon.com's Conditions of Use, they state
that downloading any part of their website except for page caching
is forbidden, and that using "robots, or similar data gathering
and extraction tools" is also not allowed.

Thankfully, however, the rules set out in Amazon's robots.txt tells
a different story. Given that these explicitly lay down the rules
for automated downloading tools, it seems reasonable too take them
as representative of accepted policy.

## robots.txt

Amazon's main robots.txt allows all of the request types we make.

## Curious

One other curious sentiment in the Conditions of Use is the clause
"we each waive any right to a jury trial." Amazon's is truly a
Brave New World.
