## TOS

Google's terms of service forbid using anything but a browser
to access their sites. This is absurd and ruinous.
See section 5.3 of http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS.

Thankfully, however, for Google Books one is only bound to it
"for digital content you purchase through the Google Books
service," which does not affect this program.
See http://www.google.com/googlebooks/tos.html

## robots.txt

Their robots.txt allows certain book pages, but disallows
others.

We use two types of URL:
http://books.google.com/books?id=<bookid>&pg=<pgcode>&jscmd=click3
http://books.google.com/books?id=<bookid>&pg=<pgcode>&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&<sig>

robots.txt disallows /books?*jscmd=* and /books?*pg=*. However,
Google consider Allow statements to overrule disallow statements
if they are longer. And they happen to allow /books?*q=subject:*.
So, we append that to both url types (it has no effect on them),
and we are obeying robots.txt
